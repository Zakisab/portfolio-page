			<h2>About <span>Me</span></h2>
			<h4>CCNA and COMPATIA</h4>
			<p> Completing my course of CCNA and Compatia security plus gave me the opportunity to enhance my skills and knowledge within an aspect of my life that I find most enjoyable. Having dedicated majority of my time to working with computers, I have always been fascinated with learning the processes, which make them work. These include computer software, data and network analysing, database systems, application and web development. This exciting journey has allowed me to learn via my experience, which has driven me to push myself further and nurture my abilities within the field.</p>
